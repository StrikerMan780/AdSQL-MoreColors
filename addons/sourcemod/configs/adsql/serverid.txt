// Define a *UNIQUE* Server ID string in this file
// that is not a partial match of any other server's
// Server ID string.  This Server ID string can then
// be set/added for an ad you when you only want it
// to display on servers with the Server ID('s) you
// specify in the Advertisements Manager web interface.
//
// Choose your Server ID string carefully -- you do NOT
// want to pick a string that is a substring match for
// another server's ID.  For example if you had two
// servers, one with Server ID "css1" and the other with
// "css13", well, when the server with ID "css1" loads
// ads from the database it is going to also load any ads
// that have "css13" in the server ID, even if that is the
// ONLY server ID specified for that ad.  "css1" is a
// partial match for "css13".  Make sense?  Using "css001"
// and "css013" would be better choices.
//
// Keep it simple - just use letters and numbers - no spaces
// or special characters.
//
// Also, understand that the plugin will *ONLY* read
// the _first_ uncommented line in this file!  If your
// server defines the wrong ID, look at this file and
// realize that the first line that doesn't start with
// "//" is what it is trying to set for the server id!
